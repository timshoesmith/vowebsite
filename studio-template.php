                    <p class="paragraph-text">Many years ago I bought an Audio Technica Cardioid microphone. It lay around for many years. When I built the booth I found it. It served me well for nearly a year. It is a good, robust piece of kit but low end. After some success I bought the Sontronics STC-3X. This added a great deal to the sound and I have been using it ever since.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph-text">I am running both an intel i7 docked laptop and an iMac. Most administration is done on the laptop and occasional editing work when I’m away from the office. However, the iMac does the heavy lifting. It is powerful enough to run the Adobe suite and it is so reliable.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph-text">I have always edited using Adobe Audition. However, I have added a few plugins along the way. Isotopes de-clicker is probably the best there is and Waves noise reduction is simple and effective. The compression in Adobe is good and practical.</p>
